# Wireframing Overview

## What Is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual representation of a web page or application interface. It emphasizes layout, structure, and functionality, rather than final design elements like color schemes or typography. Wireframes serve as the blueprint for user interfaces, helping teams visualize how users will interact with the product.

Wireframes can be created using sketches, digital tools, or design software. They are typically low-fidelity and focus on content placement, navigation flow, and interactive components.

## Why Wireframing Matters

Wireframing is a critical step in the design process for several reasons:

- **Clarifies Structure**: It defines the hierarchy and organization of content and features.
- **Improves Collaboration**: Designers, developers, and stakeholders can align on layout and functionality before investing in detailed design.
- **Enables Early Testing**: Wireframes allow for usability testing and feedback before full development begins.
- **Reduces Cost and Rework**: Identifying layout issues early helps avoid costly changes later in the process.

Starting with wireframes ensures that the final product is user-centered, functional, and well-organized.
